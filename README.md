# Sex assortativity drives male bias in TB infection

### Paige Miller, John Drake, TBD

**(record any changes to this protocol at the end of this document)**

### Background: 

Sex assortativity among social interactions is common across human populations (Mossong 2008) and male-bias in TB reporting is found in almost every country in the world (WHO). Inclusion of differential contact rates by age (Arregui 2018) and sex (Dodd 2016) are required to accurately model TB incidence patterns. 

We're wondering whether sex assortativity is correlated with male-bias across countries in real data and whether we can observe sex-assortativity to drive male-bias in network simulations. 

### Study design: 

We will simulate outbreaks of TB on networks of varying sex-assortativity and measure male-bias.

We will find social network data (e.g., sociopatterns.com) or contact matrices data (Mossong 2008), calculate assortativity coefficient for sex, and compare with WHO estimated M:F incidence in the most recent year (I believe 2018). 

### Data sources: 

* TBD on network/contact matrix data to inform sex-assortativity across countries
* WHO data is published online and has already been formatted for this analysis
* TBD Outbreak simulation code

### Analysis: 

* Correlation between male:female case reports and a measure of sex assortativity 
* Simulated male bias (ratio of male:female cases) of outbreaks on networks will be plotted against programmed sex assortativty of networks

### Checklist: 

* decide on data source for assortativity across countries
* decide on how to simulate assorted networks
* decide on how to simulate epidemics on networks
* decide on model for epidemic simulations 
* pilot study on small number of networks
* preliminary plot of correlation across country data
* once these decision have been made, develop next study checklist
