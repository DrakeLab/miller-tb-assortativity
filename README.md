# The effects of assortative mixing and susceptibility on the spread of TB 

## Background: 

__TB epidemiology:__ 

* TB is a globally distributed infectious disease
* Concentrated in parts of Africa and Asia
* Spread through respiratory transmission and is thought to require close contact
* Across the world, TB is more common among adults and men

__What causes observed variation in TB among men and women?__ 

* Prevalence studies and incidence reports match up indicating that variation is not due to access to health care or reporting 
* Most like a combination of factors alter susceptibility in men: genetics, immune responses, hormones, smoking, fat
* Potentially, higher exposure among men could be equally as important: work, school, contact, travel, leisure.. basically who you contact

__Assortativity in the number of contacts can cause differences in overall prevalence__ 

* Infections spread faster (i.e., higher $R_0$) in populations with assortative mixing among high-contact individuals
* The overall prevalence of infection in population is maximized at intermediate levels of assortativity
* Targeted contact-tracing and treating works better in populations with assortative mixing by contact 
* We know less about the effects of assortativity in sex (i.e., sex-assortativity) on overall prevalence and male-bias in TB cases and whether that alone can explain male-bias 

__Study questions:__ 

1. Can sex-assortative mixing lead to observed levels of overall TB prevalence and sex-specific TB prevalence?
2. Are sex-specific differences in susceptibility required to explain male-bias in TB cases? 

## Study design: 

We will simulate outbreaks of TB on networks of varying sex-assortativity and measure male-bias.

## Data sources: 

* WHO data for estimations of prevalence in high-burden countries (can be as high 1/4 people have LTBI)
* TBD Outbreak simulation code

## Analysis: 


## Checklist: 

* literature review on assortativity in social networks
* decide on data source for assortativity across countries
* decide on how to model assorted networks
* decide on how to model epidemics on networks
* pilot study on small number or size of networks
